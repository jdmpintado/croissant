    <h1>History of croissant</h1>
    <p>
      The croissant, though now a quintessential French pastry, actually has its
      roots in Austria. The earliest ancestor of the croissant is believed to be
      the kipferl, a crescent-shaped bread or pastry that dates back to at least
      the 13th century in Austria. A popular legend connects the kipferl to the
      1683 Battle of Vienna, when Viennese bakers, said to have been working
      early in the morning, heard Ottoman invaders tunneling and alerted the
      city. To celebrate the victory, bakers supposedly shaped pastries like the
      Ottoman crescent moon as a symbolic triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 18th century, Austrian princess Marie Antoinette, who married
      French King Louis XVI, is believed to have introduced the kipferl to the
      French court. Over time, French bakers adapted it using laminated dough, a
      technique involving layers of butter and dough, transforming it into the
      flaky, buttery pastry we know today as the croissant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laminated version we recognize now emerged in 19th-century France, and
      by the early 20th century, the croissant had become a staple of French
      boulangeries.
